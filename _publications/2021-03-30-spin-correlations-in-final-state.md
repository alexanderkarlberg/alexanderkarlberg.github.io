excerpt: |
  As part of a programme to develop parton showers with controlled logarithmic accuracy, we consider the question of collinear spin correlations within the PanScales family of parton showers. We adapt the well-known Collins–Knowles spin-correlation algorithm to PanScales antenna and dipole showers, using an approach with similarities to that taken by Richardson and Webster. To study the impact of spin correlations, we develop Lund-declustering based observables that are sensitive to spin-correlation effects both within and between jets and extend the MicroJets collinear single-logarithmic resummation code to include spin correlations. Together with a 3-point energy correlation observable proposed recently by Chen, Moult and Zhu, this provides a powerful set of constraints for validating the logarithmic accuracy of our shower results. The new observables and their resummation further open the pathway to phenomenological studies of these important quantum mechanical effects.

__Abstract__: As part of a programme to develop parton showers with controlled logarithmic accuracy, we consider the question of collinear spin correlations within the PanScales family of parton showers. We adapt the well-known Collins–Knowles spin-correlation algorithm to PanScales antenna and dipole showers, using an approach with similarities to that taken by Richardson and Webster. To study the impact of spin correlations, we develop Lund-declustering based observables that are sensitive to spin-correlation effects both within and between jets and extend the MicroJets collinear single-logarithmic resummation code to include spin correlations. Together with a 3-point energy correlation observable proposed recently by Chen, Moult and Zhu, this provides a powerful set of constraints for validating the logarithmic accuracy of our shower results. The new observables and their resummation further open the pathway to phenomenological studies of these important quantum mechanical effects.
