excerpt: |
  We calculate the fully differential next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to vector-boson fusion (VBF) Higgs pair production. This calculation is achieved in the limit in which there is no colored cross-talk between the colliding protons, using the projection-to-Born method. We present differential cross sections of key observables, showing corrections of up to 3%–4% at this order after typical VBF cuts, with the total cross section receiving contributions of about 2%. In contrast to single Higgs VBF production, we find that the NNLO corrections are for the most part within the next-to-leading order scale uncertainty bands.

__Abstract__: We calculate the fully differential next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to vector-boson fusion (VBF) Higgs pair production. This calculation is achieved in the limit in which there is no colored cross-talk between the colliding protons, using the projection-to-Born method. We present differential cross sections of key observables, showing corrections of up to 3%–4% at this order after typical VBF cuts, with the total cross section receiving contributions of about 2%. In contrast to single Higgs VBF production, we find that the NNLO corrections are for the most part within the next-to-leading order scale uncertainty bands.
