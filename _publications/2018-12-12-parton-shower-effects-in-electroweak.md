excerpt: |
  We present an implementation of &#92;(WZjj&#92;) production via vector-boson fusion in the POWHEG BOX, a public tool for the matching of next-to-leading order QCD calculations with multi-purpose parton-shower generators. We provide phenomenological results for electroweak &#92;(WZjj&#92;) production with fully leptonic decays at the LHC in realistic setups and discuss theoretical uncertainties associated with the simulation. We find that beyond the leading-order approximation the dependence on the unphysical factorization and renormalization scales is mild. The two tagging jets are furthermore very stable against parton-shower effects. However, considerable sensitivities to the shower Monte-Carlo program used are observed for central-jet veto observables.

__Abstract__: We present an implementation of &#92;(WZjj&#92;) production via vector-boson fusion in the POWHEG BOX, a public tool for the matching of next-to-leading order QCD calculations with multi-purpose parton-shower generators. We provide phenomenological results for electroweak &#92;(WZjj&#92;) production with fully leptonic decays at the LHC in realistic setups and discuss theoretical uncertainties associated with the simulation. We find that beyond the leading-order approximation the dependence on the unphysical factorization and renormalization scales is mild. The two tagging jets are furthermore very stable against parton-shower effects. However, considerable sensitivities to the shower Monte-Carlo program used are observed for central-jet veto observables.
