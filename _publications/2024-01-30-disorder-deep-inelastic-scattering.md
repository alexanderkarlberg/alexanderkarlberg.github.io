  We present a Fortran 77/95 code capable of computing QCD corrections in deep inelastic scattering (DIS). The code uses the Projection-to-Born method to augment an existing &#92;(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)&#92;) dijet DIS code, thereby obtaining predictions for photon-mediated neutral-current single-jet DIS production in the laboratory frame. The code is lightweight and fast, and yet includes the most common functionalities found in typical perturbative QCD programs, like automatic renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainties, options to run and combine multiple seeds, and interfaces to fastjet and LHAPDF. Due to the underlying disent and HOPPET codes, the program also provides stable results in the infrared, relevant for extracting logarithmic coefficients for analytic resummations, and access to the massless DIS structure functions and (reduced) cross sections up to &#92;(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)&#92;).

__Abstract__: We present a Fortran 77/95 code capable of computing QCD corrections in deep inelastic scattering (DIS). The code uses the Projection-to-Born method to augment an existing &#92;(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)&#92;) dijet DIS code, thereby obtaining predictions for photon-mediated neutral-current single-jet DIS production in the laboratory frame. The code is lightweight and fast, and yet includes the most common functionalities found in typical perturbative QCD programs, like automatic renormalisation and factorisation scale uncertainties, options to run and combine multiple seeds, and interfaces to fastjet and LHAPDF. Due to the underlying disent and HOPPET codes, the program also provides stable results in the infrared, relevant for extracting logarithmic coefficients for analytic resummations, and access to the massless DIS structure functions and (reduced) cross sections up to &#92;(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)&#92;).
