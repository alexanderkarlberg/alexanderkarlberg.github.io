excerpt: |
  We document the three main new features in the v2 release series of the HOPPET parton distribution function evolution code, specifically support for N&#92;(^3&#92;)LO QCD evolution in the variable flavour number scheme, for the determination of hadronic structure functions for massless quarks up to N&#92;(^3&#92;)LO, and for QED evolution to an accuracy phenomenologically equivalent to NNLO QCD. Additionally we describe a new Python interface, CMake build option, functionality to save a hoppet table as an LHAPDF grid and update our performance benchmarks, including optimisations in interpolating PDF tables.

__Abstract__: We document the three main new features in the v2 release series of the HOPPET parton distribution function evolution code, specifically support for N&#92;(^3&#92;)LO QCD evolution in the variable flavour number scheme, for the determination of hadronic structure functions for massless quarks up to N&#92;(^3&#92;)LO, and for QED evolution to an accuracy phenomenologically equivalent to NNLO QCD. Additionally we describe a new Python interface, CMake build option, functionality to save a hoppet table as an LHAPDF grid and update our performance benchmarks, including optimisations in interpolating PDF tables.
