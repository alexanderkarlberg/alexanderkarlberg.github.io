excerpt: |
  We present an implementation of electroweak &#92;(ZZjj&#92;) production in the POWHEG BOX V2 framework, an upgrade of the POWHEG BOX program which includes a number of new features that are particularly helpful for high-multiplicity processes. We consider leptonic and semi-leptonic decay modes of the Z bosons, and take non-resonant contributions and spin correlations of the final-state particles into account. In the case of decays to leptons, we also include interactions beyond the Standard Model that arise from an effective Lagrangian which includes CP conserving and violating operators up to dimension six. We find that while leptonic distributions are very sensitive to anomalous couplings, because of the small cross-section involved, these analyses are feasible only after a high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC. We consider the cases of a 14 TeV, 33 TeV and 100 TeV machine and discuss the limits that can be placed on those couplings for different luminosities.

__Abstract__: We present an implementation of electroweak &#92;(ZZjj&#92;) production in the POWHEG BOX V2 framework, an upgrade of the POWHEG BOX program which includes a number of new features that are particularly helpful for high-multiplicity processes. We consider leptonic and semi-leptonic decay modes of the Z bosons, and take non-resonant contributions and spin correlations of the final-state particles into account. In the case of decays to leptons, we also include interactions beyond the Standard Model that arise from an effective Lagrangian which includes CP conserving and violating operators up to dimension six. We find that while leptonic distributions are very sensitive to anomalous couplings, because of the small cross-section involved, these analyses are feasible only after a high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC. We consider the cases of a 14 TeV, 33 TeV and 100 TeV machine and discuss the limits that can be placed on those couplings for different luminosities.
