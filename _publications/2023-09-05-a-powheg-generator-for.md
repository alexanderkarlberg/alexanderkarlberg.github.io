excerpt: |
  We present a new event generator for the simulation of both neutral- and charged-current deep inelastic scattering (DIS) at next-to-leading order in QCD matched to parton showers using the POWHEG method. Our implementation builds on the existing POWHEG BOX framework originally designed for hadron-hadron collisions, supplemented by considerable extensions to account for the genuinely different kinematics inherent to lepton-hadron collisions. In particular, we present new momentum mappings that conserve the special kinematics found in DIS, which we use to modify the POWHEG BOX implementation of the Frixione-Kunszt-Signer subtraction mechanism. We compare our predictions to fixed-order and resummed predictions, as well as to data from the HERA ep collider. Finally we study a few representative distributions for the upcoming Electron Ion Collider.

__Abstract__: We present a new event generator for the simulation of both neutral- and charged-current deep inelastic scattering (DIS) at next-to-leading order in QCD matched to parton showers using the POWHEG method. Our implementation builds on the existing POWHEG BOX framework originally designed for hadron-hadron collisions, supplemented by considerable extensions to account for the genuinely different kinematics inherent to lepton-hadron collisions. In particular, we present new momentum mappings that conserve the special kinematics found in DIS, which we use to modify the POWHEG BOX implementation of the Frixione-Kunszt-Signer subtraction mechanism. We compare our predictions to fixed-order and resummed predictions, as well as to data from the HERA ep collider. Finally we study a few representative distributions for the upcoming Electron Ion Collider.
