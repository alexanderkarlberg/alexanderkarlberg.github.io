excerpt: |
  We present a benchmark comparison of the massless inclusive deep-inelastic-scattering (DIS) structure functions up to &#92;(\mathcal {O}(\alpha _s ^3)&#92;) in perturbative QCD. The comparison is performed using the codes apfel++ and hoppet within the framework of the variable-flavour-number scheme and over a broad kinematic range relevant to the extraction of parton distribution functions. We provide results for both the single structure functions and the reduced cross sections in both neutral- and charged-current DIS. Look-up tables for future reference are included, and we also release the code used for the benchmark.

__Abstract__: We present a benchmark comparison of the massless inclusive deep-inelastic-scattering (DIS) structure functions up to &#92;(\mathcal {O}(\alpha _s ^3)&#92;) in perturbative QCD. The comparison is performed using the codes apfel++ and hoppet within the framework of the variable-flavour-number scheme and over a broad kinematic range relevant to the extraction of parton distribution functions. We provide results for both the single structure functions and the reduced cross sections in both neutral- and charged-current DIS. Look-up tables for future reference are included, and we also release the code used for the benchmark.
