  We report on a major milestone in the construction of logarithmically accurate final-state parton showers, achieving next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy for the wide class of observables known as event shapes. The key to this advance lies in the identification of the relation between critical NNLL analytic resummation ingredients and their parton-shower counterparts. Our analytic discussion is supplemented with numerical tests of the logarithmic accuracy of three shower variants for more than a dozen distinct event-shape observables in <math display="inline"><mrow><mi>Z</mi><mo stretchy="false">→</mo><mi>q</mi><mover accent="true"><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">¯</mo></mrow></mover></mrow></math> and <math display="inline"><mrow><mi>Higgs</mi><mo stretchy="false">→</mo><mi>g</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow></math> decays.

__Abstract__: We report on a major milestone in the construction of logarithmically accurate final-state parton showers, achieving next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy for the wide class of observables known as event shapes. The key to this advance lies in the identification of the relation between critical NNLL analytic resummation ingredients and their parton-shower counterparts. Our analytic discussion is supplemented with numerical tests of the logarithmic accuracy of three shower variants for more than a dozen distinct event-shape observables in <math display="inline"><mrow><mi>Z</mi><mo stretchy="false">→</mo><mi>q</mi><mover accent="true"><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">¯</mo></mrow></mover></mrow></math> and <math display="inline"><mrow><mi>Higgs</mi><mo stretchy="false">→</mo><mi>g</mi><mi>g</mi></mrow></math> decays. The NNLL terms are phenomenologically sizeable, as illustrated in comparisons to data.
