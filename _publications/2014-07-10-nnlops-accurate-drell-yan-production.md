excerpt: |
  We present a next-to-next-to-leading order accurate description of Drell-Yan lepton pair production processes through γ&#92;(^{*}&#92;) /Z or W exchange that includes consistently parton shower effects. Results are obtained by upgrading the vector-boson plus one jet NLO calculation in POWHEG with the MINLO procedure and by applying an appropriate reweighting procedure making use of the DYNNLO program. We compare to existing data and to accurate resummed calculations.

__Abstract__: We present a next-to-next-to-leading order accurate description of Drell-Yan lepton pair production processes through γ&#92;(^{*}&#92;) /Z or W exchange that includes consistently parton shower effects. Results are obtained by upgrading the vector-boson plus one jet NLO calculation in POWHEG with the MINLO procedure and by applying an appropriate reweighting procedure making use of the DYNNLO program. We compare to existing data and to accurate resummed calculations.
