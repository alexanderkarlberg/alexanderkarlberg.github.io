Thanks for visiting my profile page!

I am currently working as a Senior Research Fellow in the Theory Department at CERN. My interests are in perturbative QCD and event generators.

For an up2date list of my publications, please consult [iNSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1069015).

Currently most of my work is focused on improving parton showers and higher order matching methods. The public part of that work can be found in the [PanScales repository](https://gitlab.com/panscales/panscales-0.X).

Since v1.3.0 I am also a developer of the parton evolution code [Hoppet](https://github.com/hoppet-code/hoppet). The related n3lo structure function benchmark results carried out in [2404.15711](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15711) can be found [here](https://github.com/alexanderkarlberg/n3lo-structure-function-benchmarks).
